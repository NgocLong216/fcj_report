### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is very friendly and open. Team members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace is well-organized and comfortable, helping me stay focused.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provided thorough guidance, explained clearly whenever I didn’t fully understand something, and always encouraged me to ask questions. The team admin supported administrative procedures, documents, and created favorable conditions for my work. I especially appreciated that my mentor allowed me to explore solutions on my own instead of giving the answer immediately.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The assigned tasks matched well with my academic background while also introducing me to new topics I had not encountered before. This helped reinforce my foundational knowledge and build additional hands-on experience.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Throughout the internship, I gained various new skills, including working with cloud tools, collaborating in a team, and communicating professionally in a corporate setting. My mentor also shared practical insights that helped me better shape my future career direction.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company fosters a positive culture where everyone respects each other and works efficiently while still maintaining a comfortable atmosphere. During urgent projects, the whole team collaborates and supports one another, regardless of role. This made me feel truly integrated into the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company offers internship allowances and provides flexibility with working hours, creating supportive conditions for interns.

### Suggestions & Expectations
- What I appreciate the most is the flexible work schedule, allowing me to freely arrange and register office days.

- If possible, I would recommend friends in the same field to intern at AWS because, besides the knowledge learned at school, interns also gain valuable experience in cloud computing.
